AIAA is a vehicle registration plugin used to register vehicles using their VIN numbers. This plugin utilizes an API for VIN details and consists of three modules:

Modules
Customer Module:

Customers can register themselves and create a customer account.
Customers can create an appraisal for their vehicle to register it by entering the VIN number.
The API fetches data regarding the vehicle, and many fields are filled in by the customer themselves. The appraisal is then created.
Manager Module:

Managers have their own accounts created by the admin and have full access.
Managers can approve or reject appraisals, view reports, and email customers regarding any issues with their appraisals. All customer appraisals are checked by the manager.
Admin Module:

Admins have full access and can directly message managers and customers.
Admins can also check appraisals, approve payments, and handle any issues.
